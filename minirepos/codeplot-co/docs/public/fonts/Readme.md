Don't be a copycat. With or without the fonts, do not clone our products or our website. Selling our work under your name is blatantly disrespectful and criminal. Distributing knockoffs of our work for free doesn't make you Robin Hood either. We do not approve of free plugins or themes for other apps and other counterfeits that imitate our products. They're poor quality, they undermine our business, and they openly violate our copyright. Due to their poor quality, they tarnish our reputation. They're unethical, illegal, and lame.
