**tl;dr**: ▱ codeplot - an tool for interactive code-driven data exploration. Plot graphs, data frames and much more on a spatial canvas using plain python/Javascript code.

Created by [@antl3x](https://github.com/antl3x). You can read why on [this blog post.](https://antl3x.co/posts/2024-01-25-today-i-decided-to-create-a-tool-that-i-always-wanted/)

We aim to bridge the gap between traditional coding environments like Jupyter / Spyder and the world of interactive spatial canvas.

## Why codeplot?

Tired of static images and endless scrolling in Jupyter or fixed rigid plots images on your IDE? codeplot is here to change that. Imagine a tool that not only complements but enhances your coding workflow with dynamic, spatial data visualization. That's codeplot for you!

### codeplot vs. Traditional Tools

- **codeplot**: A perfect companion to your data exploration. Visualize your data on an interactive canvas, and explore it like never before!

- **Seamless Integration**: You can plot things to your canvas using our Python package or our JavaScript npm module directly from your code / repl.
